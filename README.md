# @eagleeye-solutions/integration-events-common

This package provides a framework for building integrations (Connectors) between the [Eagle Eye AIR](https://eagleeye.com/air-platform) platform and third-party Customer Data Platforms.

Applications built with this framework are intended to be deployed to GCP Cloud Run as container images. GCP Pub/Sub is used to facilitate intra-process communication.

## Installation

### npm

```
npm install @eagleeye-solutions/integration-events-common
```

## Getting Started

Create an instance of the connector based on a supplied configuration object - note that the connector is a standard express.js application:

```typescript
import {connector, ApplicationConfig} from '@eagleeye-solutions/integration-events-common';

const applicationConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  platformConfig: {
    platform: 'GCP',
    projectId: 'my-project',
    internalMessagesTopicName: 'internal-messages',
    cdpDeadLetterQueue: 'internal-messages-dlq',
    pubSubAuthenticatedPushServiceAccount: 'some-service-account',
    pubSubAuthenticatedPushAudience: 'my-connector-europe-west2',
  },
  configPlatform: 'my-platform',
  configOverride: process.env.CONFIG_OVERRIDE
    ? JSON.parse(process.env.CONFIG_OVERRIDE)
    : undefined,
  configUrl: 'https://config-api.example.org',
  routes: {
    internal: {
      path: '/internal',
      getInternalMessageFromRequest,
      handlers: {
        'cdp-outbound-event': handleCdpOutboundEvent,
        'cdp-inbound-event': handleCdpInboundEvent,
        'ee-air-inbound-event': handleEeAirInboundEvent,
        'ee-air-outbound-event': handleEeAirOutboundEvent,
      },
    },
  },
  appMetadata: {
    name: packageJson.name,
    version: packageJson.version,
    tagline: 'Sample API Connector',
  },
  handlePermanentMessageDeliveryFailure,
  traceIdName: 'x-ees-connector-trace-id',
  includeTraceIdInHttpResponseHeaders: true,
};

connector(applicationConfig)
    .then(app => {
        app.listen(8080, () => {
            console.log('Listening on port 8080');
        });
    })
    .catch(err => {
        console.error(`Failed to start application: ${err.toString()}`);
    });
```
